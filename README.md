# Rusty
A proof of concept of an exploit written in Rust for the game Roblox. Only for educational purposes in regards to low level programming and security.

### How to build (x32, ik i am did a stupid mistake code to the outdated platform)
```
rustup target add i686-pc-windows-msvc            
cargo clean
cargo build --target=i686-pc-windows-msvc --release  
```
If you want to use it seriously, you need port it to x64 only platform.
Made with Claude 4.5 (Sonnet) because i only started to learn rust yet (i know Nim or C# better than rust because more simple syntax).
And anyway, i making a beats in fl studio rn, i have no enought time to learn how to code ðŸ˜¡
